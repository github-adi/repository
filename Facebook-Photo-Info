You can also hook up another machine from what I was told so that is a huge advantage. As a digital artist it felt right. Apple pen still works better, but the iPad has nothing on that display and the dial is sweet. The display is seriously incredible. This is definitely targeting a specific professional artist group, curious to how it adapts over time for the average user. BTW Im an apple person, you got my attention with this product.

Es increble que esto lo este haciendo una empresa como Microsoft. He pagado 2 Surface y tengo una. Adems la nueva tiene problemas de pantalla.

They pointed me to their rules that I must send a private message, rather than expose their incompetencies to the world , so I decided let me use Linked so as to circumvent their arrogant authoritarian attitude and let people know before new potential users waste their money. Of course this started when Skype was sold to we all know who. A lot of similarities with the missing start on windows 8 and the initial arrogance when everyone complained there..\nThe latest is the SMS from Skype, in conjunction with Skype phone numbers, this has been moved from the settings in the desktop app to web based, and along with this one can no longer use the nearest number to the destination for calls, and at the same time receive sms on ones mobile phone. If it is there it is not obvious and their totally inadequate customer services and inability to field direct service requests is no help in getting any solution.\nAmazing how all these companies start out asking users to help and play a part in how the product will look, then reach a tipping point where it becomes a who are you to tell us how to make our product.  I can name quite a few with this attitude. Windows 10 anyone?\n\nPlease everyone, remind your shareholders that without the customers there would be no shares to hold.",

I will NOT upgrade to Windows 10 because a number of my software programs will not work with Windows 10.  So if Microsoft were to force Windows 10 onto my desktop then I would be filing suit as Microsoft would in fact be costing me a loss of money because I would have to buy some new software packages.

My brother has an xbox one, and after downloading a game from them he discovered the game didnt load correctly and he couldnt play it. He called microsoft, and the tried to troubleshoot the issues. Finally Microsoft told him the would refund him the money and he needed to uninstall the game and then go repurchase the game and install it again. Well, the game still does not work. So he called back asking for a refund only to be told Im sorry, we only give 1 refund a year. Are you kidding me?!?! you should have told him this from the start! SO now he has to wait an entire year to get his money refunded for a game he cant even play. He has called 5 times, and asked everyone if theres anything they can do. He has been proised call backs from managers and higher up tech support. Never have they actually called him. Not even once. Just giving him the run around. Our family has quickly become a sony play station fan. Please reconsider before you purchase one of these",

I spent almost an hour ok the phone with the tech dpartment and they sad i should write a post on a third party site and thenthat third party sote would help. . Why cant they help fix their own product?! Anyways, I asked the lady on the the phone if i could just send in my xbox one and the they send me a ps4. Ha. Then i told her i am willing to donate my xbox to science so theu can learn how to fix their own products. Ha. Ill never buy another xbox. And Ive been a loyal customer with them for a decade. Oh and as i waiting to speak with a supervisor, the lady hung up on me. Way to go microsoft.",

Not now, maybe later or maybe never but NO means NO! @ least I thought it did or should!\n\nWhile I was sleeping, you forced your Windows 10 Upgrade (GWX) on me & my PC! You violated my privacy & trust! You forced this on me, without my permission...kind of like someone telling you they dont want to go out with you...then you stalk them or no, I dont want to have sex with you...then you rape them! \n\nLuckily, I can revert my system back to the older OS Im accustomed to, hopefully without any problems. I will also install preventive measures on all of my PC’s to keep the “forced upgrade” @ bay until I’m good & ready! I’ve been a PC user longer than most of your employees have been alive.\n\nAs I stated previously, I will install GWX when I’m ready & not before! It’s my choice not yours & if you continue to force my hand with trickery, my hands may be resting on the keyboards of Mac’s in the future! \n\nSincerely,\nJohn Brocksmith",

Our approach is to use engineering to create social change. This is different from most philanthropy. Lots of people invest capital and hard work, but when you can also do engineering to build tools to empower people to make changes themselves, thats when social change... can really scale. Thats what were doing to help teachers bring personalized learning tools into hundreds of schools. Thats what were doing to help scientists build new tools that can help cure, prevent and manage all diseases within our childrens lifetime. Bringing engineering to social change is the basic idea of our work, and one of the unique capabilities we can provide. Building a world-class engineering team starts with a great leader. Brian is a great engineering leader who Ive wanted to work with for a long time. He has been the Vice President of Search at Amazon and the General Manager of Amazons search and ad technology group. He has been working on important technology problems for 20 years, including building software and tools for the Department of Molecular Biology and building the first ever internet search engine, Web Crawler, while he was in his PhD program at the University of Washington. At the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brians job will be to build a world-class engineering team to help take on some of the biggest opportunities and challenges our society faces today. Im confident that under his leadership we’ll recruit a great team and work closely with our partners to find out what tools need to be created to unlock these major opportunities to benefit everyone. On behalf of our entire team, I want to welcome Brian to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Im looking forward to working with him as we redefine the intersection of engineering and social change.

Whenever I went to visit him, his mother will tell me he is not at home. \n\nMy friend started giving me attitude. He stopped coming to my house. I asked him what the problem was, he opened up and told me his mother had Warned him to stop associating with me because I might not be happy he gained admission, while I was still at home. \nAh I cried Sha. \n\nHonestly I was pained. \nFast forward 5 years later, I have gained admission, and even graduated, my friend was still in the University. It was a 5 Years course but he changed department  and ended up spending 6 Years.\n\nHis mother saw me in the neighborhood shortly after graduation and asked if I was on holiday. Holiday ke? Ma  I have graduated. You can imagine the look on her face. Epic. Lol\nI graduated with 2nd class upper,a year later he graduated with 3rd class\n\nSome of us are guilty of this. \n*When we have a house filled with kids.... Our loyal friend struggling to have kids becomes an enemy. We push them away \n\n*Once we get married... Our loyal single friend becomes an enemy.. We push them away \n\n*Once we get a job... Our loyal jobless friend becomes an enemy.... We push them away. \n\n*Once we get to the top... Our loyal friends at the bottom becomes an enemy.... We push away. \n\n*When we are happily married... Our loyal friend that is unfortunately a widow or divorcee becomes an enemy.... We push them away\n\n*When we have food and water... Our loyal friend struggling to survive becomes an enemy... We push them away. \n\n*Nobody is your enemy, you are only being an enemy to them \nWe quickly forget... Life is not static. It moves and changes \n. \nWhen you condemn a situation along with the person in the situation. You are only gambling. \n\nAt the end, the winner might be the person you condemned, the person you least expected.\n\n#Copied\n\nThis is food for thought.

I would like to put a proposal in your multi-tasking brain.\nSir, please create an icon on the cover page (make it optional / mandatory) naming or indicating “Blood Group” visible to all.\nYou know many people are being hospitalized every moment.

And I think you will ,of course, want it.\nI know I am a tiny member of your Facebook world but my requirement is definitely a big one.\nYou are always with the betterment of the human being people know so. Form that courage, I am eagerly waiting for not to be neglected.\nI hope you will read my message and at least reply (positively).\nThank you sir!!\n\nWriter Credits - Rabiul Islam",

      "text": "Time for more science! Our friends Reid Hoffman and Michelle Yee just announced theyre joining the movement and committing $20 million to support the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in its mission to help cure all diseases in our childrens lifetime.  The Biohub has already started working on two big projects. The Human Cell Atlas will be a detailed map of all cells that control the bodys major organs. The Infectious Disease Initiative will create new tools for fighting diseases lik...e HIV, Ebola and Zika. All of these tools will be available to the whole scientific community to accelerate progress on some of the most important questions in science and medicine. When Priscilla and I announced our science initiative in September, we hoped more people would realize that its possible to cure all diseases -- and get them involved in making it happen.  Reid and Michelle’s gift will go towards bringing even more of the best scientists and engineers together at the Biohub as we work to create a better world for our children. Im grateful for their friendship and support. You can see Reids note here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/symbiosis-biohub-reid-hoffman See more",

Thats why youve probably seen us actively encouraging everyone who can vote, to go vote. Youll see a lot more reminders to vote until the election. So far, more than 2 million people have registered to vote by going through Facebook, some for the first time, according to estimates based on available... data. This makes it one of the largest voter registration programs in history. This cycle, weve shown 150 million people old enough to vote a link to register right in our app. At least 16 states saw voter registration spikes during these campaigns compared to the day before -- in some cases increasing registrations by 23x! Were now running a similar campaign to encourage people to actually go out and vote. Based on our estimates, we hope to encourage millions of people who might otherwise stay home to get engaged on election day. We also created the Election Hub, where you can get directions to your polling place, learn about your local candidates and ballot measures, and share that youve voted to encourage your friends to vote too. Check it out at: facebook.com/elections/us2016 Ive always believed real change comes from giving every person a voice. When I first started Facebook, I hoped one day we could help people build movements to create change. I still believe this today. Our community is a platform for all ideas. The people who registered through Facebook will vote for all candidates. Our mission is to give everyone the power to share, so each of you can help create the change you want to see in the world. Please make your voice heard and go vote. See more",

People are creating and sharing more video than ever, so were building new tools to make it easier to express yourself in creative ways....
